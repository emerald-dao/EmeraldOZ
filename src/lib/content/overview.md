# Overview

Welcome to Emerald OZ, the <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts" target="_blank">OpenZeppelin</a> for the <a href="https://flow.com" target="_blank">Flow blockchain</a> created by <a href="https://ecdao.org" target="_blank">Emerald City</a>.

This resource is **heavily** inspired by OpenZeppelin itself, so much credit is due. Emerald OZ intentionally mimics the structure & wording of OpenZeppelin to make it easier for devs to understand the differences between Cadence and Solidity.

<Notice type="tip">
  If you're new to smart contract development, or new to Cadence in general, head to the <a href="https://academy.ecdao.org/en/catalog/courses/beginner-cadence" target="_blank">Beginner Cadence Course</a> created by us.
